# Ghost(Linux Fileless Malware)
Ghost is a Linux Fileless Malware that creates a reverse shell back to the attacker machine taking advantage of the fork() system call. The malware 
spawns a remote blind shell on the attacker system and removes itself after execution, hence leaving no footprints on the target system.
